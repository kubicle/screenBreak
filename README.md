- To give it a quick test, [run it](http://rawgit.com/kubicle/screenBreak/master/index.html) in your browser.

- If you like it, install [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/) then start it as an app from command line. Example: 
```SH
# Suppose you have screenNbreak repo checked out in ~/Documents/tools/screenBreak
# and NW.js files copied to ~/Documents/tools/nw
cd ~/Documents/tools/screenBreak
~/Documents/tools/nw/nwjs-v0.52.0-osx-x64/nwjs.app/Contents/MacOS/nwjs .
```

# Indications
This tiny application can help you minimize various health and efficiency issues created by sitting too long in front of a computer screen:
- Backache
- Shoulder & neck pain
- Leg circulatory issues
- Headache
- Trouble of concentration

CAUTION: As usual for any persisting symptoms, if you do not feel right you should see a doctor!

# How does it work? 
When you sit down, click on the "I am here" button.

![sb1-iamhere arrow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5130338/20453195/097aadb4-ae60-11e6-8eb2-b9a92a7fe4d7.png)

The gauge will start moving slowly from green to amber, then to red.
It takes one hour to fill up entirely.

Once the red zone is filled, the gauge will turn entirely red. A moment later, it will start flashing annoyingly.
This is when you are supposed to take a break.

Tap on the "Take a break" button, then stand up and enjoy your break!

While you are away the gauge will progressively move back to amber, then green.
Of course you can take a break before you see the full red annoyingly-flashing gauge; this is actually recommended! Read more below...

# How often should you take a break? 
At least once every hour, a 5 minute break is recommended.
If you can take micro-breaks (e.g. a few seconds or a minute) more often, this is even better, but not all tasks allow that.

# What if you have something to finish? 
We all know that feeling: the result of your work is close to perfect, just a few details to iron out,
so you feel like getting it done right now instead of interrupting this "winning streak"...

So go ahead and tap the break button, then right away the "I am here" button.
This makes the annoying alert keep quiet for around 10 minutes. You can repeat this if you need even more time.

*However*, make sure you read the paragraph below so you know why this is not the best thing to do... 

# Why delaying your break is not recommended
- Your concentration will decrease after a time that varies depending on the person, health status, type of work, time of day, etc. 
- Many small breaks repair better than a single long one. Just as it is better to make regular 7h sleep nights instead of waking 34h in a row then sleep 14h! 
- This is when you start feeling tired that you take the worst shortcuts or wrong decisions. Something in your mind starts to repetitively tell you to hurry and finish it so you can take a happy rest. If you work instead of resting right now, chances are that, later, you will have to fix or redo part of the work you performed in bad conditions. 

# Other tricks
- The secret is in breaking the routine in multiple and various ways. What usually hurts your body are long, uninterrupted, efforts.
- Drink tea. When your cup is empty, you need to get up to refill it! 
- Drink a lot of water from a bottle. Beside covering your hydration needs, going more often to the bathroom also gives you valid breaks from your screen.
- If there is no relaxing place near your desk, find a routine walk; for example to any place nearby that sells a snack, bottled water, magazines, etc. Or someone working in the same building available for 3 minutes of chit-chat...
- And of course, by "resting", we mean leave your screen and your seat away. Best is to stand up and walk. If there is a more comfortable place than your seat nearby, like a sofa, this can also be great from time to time.
- Our brain consumes glucose to perform its tasks. See for example an article like this one: http://www.eufic.org/article/en/artid/glucose-mental-performance/
